title: "OrayVPN failed to ping each other when connecting to eduroam"

A strange thing happened this morning. I failed to connect my desktop with my laptop connecting to eduroam, but succeeded when connecting to my cellphone's hotspot.

By runing `route print` in CMD, the interface of that entry is found to be set to WLAN:

However, when connecting to hotspot, the interface is set to the virtual adapter of VPN.

The solution is manully delete and create a new entry with correct interface.
```cmd
route delete <entryIP>
route add <entryIP> mask <MASK> <GATEWAY> <INTERFACE> metric 56 if <INTERFACE>
```
The interface id is shown in `route print`
Or, I set the adapter's mask to cover all the devices in my VPN, so just delete that entry would be fine.
